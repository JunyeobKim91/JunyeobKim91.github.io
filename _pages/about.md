# Junyeob Kim
**Ph.D. Candidate in Economics**, North Carolina State University  

My research focuses on **commodity markets, international trade, and time-series econometrics**.  
I study how global commodity price super-cycles interact with macroeconomic activity and international financial linkages.  

I am currently on the 2025â€“2026 job market.  
You can find my [Job Market Paper](/assets/Kim_JMP_2025.pdf) and [CV](/assets/Kim_CV_2025.pdf) here.
